<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

Census Designated Places (CDP) delineated by the US Census Bureau to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.
Most boundaries represented by this shapefile are as of January 1, 2013, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates that occurred after January 1, 2013, such as newly incorporated places, are also included.  The boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.

</dd>
<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.
The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.

<dt><em>Logical_Consistency_Report:</em>  
<dd>

The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles.  Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons are tested for closure.
The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.
For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table.  For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature.  TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification.  Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.

Data completeness of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflects the contents of the Census MAF/TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line Shapefiles were created.

TIGER/Line Shapefiles are extracted from the Census MAF/TIGER database by nation, state, county, and entity.  Census MAF/TIGER data for all of the aforementioned geographic entities are then distributed among the shapefiles each containing attributes for line, polygon, or landmark geographic data.

Data downloaded from American Fact Finder. Used the Select By Location tool to select all polygons intersecting the Rhode Island state boundary. Exported this selection to its own shapefile,  then re-projected the data from GCS North American, to Rhode Island State Plane Feet.  Deleted all records that did not represent a Census Designated Place (CDP). 
Data contributed to RIGIS by the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center. Metadata were adapted, minor updates made to content, RIGIS distribution information added. Credit for primary source metadata authorship remains with the U.S. Census Bureau.

The GEOID attribute is a concatenation of: a) the state FIPS code, and b) the place FIPS code. No spaces are allowed between the two codes. The State FIPS code is taken from &quot;National Standard Codes (ANSI INCITS 38-2009), Federal Information Processing Series(FIPS) - States&quot;. The place FIPS code is taken from FederalInformation Processing Series Census Codes for Named Populated Places, Primary County Divisions, and other Locational Entities of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (Formerly FIPS 55-3)
